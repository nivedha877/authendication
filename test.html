    <p >The DOMContentLoaded event fires when the HTML document 
      has been completely parsed, and all deferred scripts have downloaded and executed. 
      It doesn't wait for other things like images, subframes, and async scripts to finish loading.
    </p>
      <div id="DOMMoreText" class="hidden-text">
      DOMContentLoaded does not wait for stylesheets to load, however deferred scripts do wait for stylesheets, 
      and the DOMContentLoaded event is queued after deferred scripts. Also, scripts which aren't deferred or asyn
      will wait for already-parsed stylesheets to load.A different event, load, should be used only to detect a fully
      -loaded page. It is a common mistake to use load where DOMContentLoaded would be more appropriate.This event is not 
      cancelable.
